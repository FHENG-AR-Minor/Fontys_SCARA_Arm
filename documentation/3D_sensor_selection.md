## Introduction
For this project is a 3D vision sensor needed to generate a pointcloud that is needed for following surfaces with the Scara arm. With this link of a [3D camera survey](http://rosindustrial.org/news/2016/1/13/3d-camera-survey) of the ROS blog we consider a few sensors which are available from the Fontys Mechatronics lectorate.
